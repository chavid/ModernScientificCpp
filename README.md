# Modern Scientific C++

This set of notebooks will first guide you through the modern C++ syntax. This will be the basement for the later understanding of modern C++ standard library, your first tool for scientific computing. You can download this training materials thanks to the commmand:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/chavid/ModernScientificCpp.git
```

The course is organized as an alternation of days in common (physically or virtually) and optional weeks of intersession during which you have to do exercises individually, at a rate of 1h30 per day.

## [Preparation before the course](0-Preparation/README.md)

## [First collective day](1-ClassRoom/README.md)

Problems central to early C++, best practices that address them, now syntactical innovations in modern C++.

* Morning   1 (1h30) : [Get in touch](1-ClassRoom/1-/)
* Morning   2 (1h30) : [Revisions](1-ClassRoom/2-/)
* Afternoon 1 (1h30) : [New syntax](1-ClassRoom/3-/)
* Afternoon 2 (1h30) : [Coding dojo](1-ClassRoom/4-/)

## [Second collective day](2-ClassRoom/README.md)

Topics more focused on the standard library, new good practices, and various programming styles.

* Morning 1 (1h30) : [Cpp Core Guidelines & Guideline Support Library](3-ClassRoom/1-CoreGuidelines/README.md)
* Morning 2 (1h30) : [Template meta-programming](3-ClassRoom/2-TemplateMetaProgramming/README.md)
* Afternoon 1 (1h30) : [Functional programming](3-ClassRoom/3-FunctionalProgramming/README.md)
* Afternoon 2 (1h30) : [Concurrent programming](3-ClassRoom/4-ConcurrentProgramming/README.md)

## [Third collective day](3-ClassRoom/README.md)

Some themes more specific to scientific computing: giving units to values, control the accuracy of its calculation, optimize its data structure.

- Morning 1 (1h30) : [Profiling](1-Profiling/README.ipynb)
- Morning 2 (1h30) : [Optimization](2-Optimization/README.ipynb)
- Afternoon 1 (1h30) : [Floating point computing](3-FloatingPointComputing/README.ipynb)
- Afternoon 2 (1h30) : [Quantities and units](4-QuantitiesAndUnits/README.ipynb)

## Credits

This project is mainly made of content written by David Chamont (CNRS) over many years. Vincent Rouvreau (INRIA) has contributed few documents when helping for a 2018 session. Olga Abramkina and Karim Hasnaoui (CNRS) have transated into english a large subset of the course, for the PRACE session at the beginning of 2021.

The final common day, more dedicated to the scientific computing facets, largely benefits from debates and experiments with the members of the IN2P3 project [Reprises](https://reprises.in2p3.fr/) (french only): Hadrien Grasland, Pierre Aubert, Vincent Lafage, etc.
