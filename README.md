## Credits

This project is mainly made of content written by David Chamont (CNRS) over many years. Vincent Rouvreau (INRIA) has contributed few documents when helping for a 2018 session. Olga Abramkina and Karim Hasnaoui (CNRS) have transated into english a large subset of the course, for the PRACE session at the beginning of 2021.

The final common day, more dedicated to the scientific computing facets, largely benefits from debates and experiments with the members of the IN2P3 project [Reprises](https://reprises.in2p3.fr/) (french only): Hadrien Grasland, Pierre Aubert, Vincent Lafage, etc.
