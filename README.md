# Modern Scientific C++

This set of notebooks will first guide you through the modern C++ syntax. It will be the basement for the later understanding of modern C++ standard library, your first tool for scientific computing. You can download this training materials thanks to the commmand:
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/chamont/modernscientificcpp.git ModernScientificCpp
```

The course is organized as an alternation of days in common (physically or virtually) and weeks of intersession during which you have to do exercises individually, at a rate of 1h30 per day.

## [First collective day](1-ClassRoom/en.index.md)

Revisions and first introduction to new syntax. We take this opportunity to get to know each other, create accounts on the forum that will be used during the intersessional period, and to become familiar with notebooks.

* Morning 1 (1h30) : [Get in touch](1-ClassRoom/1-GetInTouch/)
* Morning 2 (1h30) : [Revisions](1-ClassRoom/2-Reminders/README.ipynb)
* Afternoon 1 (1h30) : [New syntax](1-ClassRoom/3-NewSyntaxes/README.ipynb)
* Afternoon 2 (1h30) : [Coding dojo](1-ClassRoom/4-CodingDojo/en.index.md)

## [First inter-session](2-HomeWork/en.index.md)

More in-depth study of **new C++ syntax**, and work on **personal code**.

* Day 1 (1h30) : [General modernization](2-HomeWork/1-ModernizeYourCode/README.ipynb)
* Day 2 (1h30) : [Better use of references and pointers](2-HomeWork/2-ReferencesAndPointers/README.ipynb)
* Day 3 (1h30) : [Always more templates](2-HomeWork/3-Generic/README.ipynb)
* Day 4 (1h30) : [First steps in functional programming](2-HomeWork/4-Functional/README.ipynb)

## [Second collective day](3-ClassRoom/en.index.md)

Topics more focused on the standard library, new good practices, and various programming styles.

* Morning 1 (1h30) : [Cpp Core Guidelines & Guideline Support Library](3-ClassRoom/1-CoreGuidelines/README.md)
* Morning 2 (1h30) : [Template meta-programming](3-ClassRoom/2-TemplateMetaProgramming/README.md)
* Afternoon 1 (1h30) : [Functional programming](3-ClassRoom/3-FunctionalProgramming/README.md)
* Afternoon 2 (1h30) : [Concurrent programming](3-ClassRoom/4-ConcurrentProgramming/README.md)

## [Second intersession](4-HomeWork/en.index.md)

Read the [core guidelines](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines),
practice the **new standard library**, and work on your **personal code**.
<!--
## [Third collective day](5-ClassRoom/en.index.md)

Some themes more specific to scientific computing: giving units to values, control the accuracy of its calculation, optimize its data structure. Plus an overview of C++20.

* Morning 1 (1h30) : [Quantities and units](1-QuantitiesAndUnits/README.ipynb)
* Morning 2 (1h30) : [Floating point computing](2-FloatingPointComputing/README.ipynb)
* Afternoon 1 (1h30) : [Optimisation](3-Optimisation/README.ipynb)
* Afternoon 2 (1h30) : [A glimpse to C++20](4-Cpp20Glimpse/README.ipynb)

## Credits

This project is mainly made of content written by David Chamont (CNRS) over many years. Vincent Rouvreau (INRIA) has contributed few documents when helping for a 2018 session. Olga Abramkina and Karim Hasnaoui (CNRS) have transated into english a large subset of the course, for the PRACE session at the beginning of 2021.

The final common day, more dedicated to the scientific computing facets, largely benefits from debates and experiments with the members of the IN2P3 project [Reprises](https://reprises.in2p3.fr/)(french only): Hadrien Grasland, Pierre Aubert, Vincent Lafage, etc.
