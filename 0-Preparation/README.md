# Prepare yourself for the lessons

The prerequisites for this lesssons are given in `prerequisites.md`, together with links to courses and online tutorials which may help to fill the gaps.

For communication with the teachers and other students, you are asked to connect on this server: `https://discord.gg/MycuXgV3`. Some more information is given in `chatroom.md`.

As better described in `teaching-material.md`, the material will be made available, progressively, on [this public project](https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/chamont/modernscientificcpp).

The file [`installation.md`](installation.md) try to sum up what to install if you want to run the examples on your machine, with or without notebooks, barebone or through docker (in the later case, additional instructions are found in `docker.md`). You can also, at least at the beginning, simply use http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/. Finally, if you have an account in the RENATER federation, you may use [JupyterHub@Paris-Saclay](`https://jupyterhub.ijclab.in2p3.fr/`) (see `jupyterhub.md`).
