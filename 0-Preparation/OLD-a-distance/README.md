# Prepare yourself for the lessons

The prerequisites for this lesssons are given in `prerequisites.md`, together with links to courses and online tutorials which may help to fill the gaps.

For communication with the teachers and other students, you are asked to connect on this server: `https://discord.gg/MycuXgV3`. Some more information is given in `chatroom.md`.

As better described in `teaching-material.md`, the material will be made available, progressively, on [this public project](https://github.com/chavid/ModernScientificCpp.git).

You can copy the C++ examples from the material, and paste it in your favorite C++ tools. As long as the examples are short enough, you can simply use the web service [CoLiRu](http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/). If you want/need to compile yourself on your own machine, you may need to install a recent compiler, such as described at the beginning of [`installation.md`](installation.md).

If you want to interact directly with the notebooks, there is also a web service available, called [binder](https://mybinder.org/). So to start such a service : browse the main `README.md` file at the top of the [repository](https://github.com/chavid/ModernScientificCpp.git), and click on the "launch binder" button. The first time, because it building a docker image on the fly, the launch time may be VERY long.

If you have an account in the RENATER federation, you may use [JupyterHub@Paris-Saclay](`https://jupyterhub.ijclab.in2p3.fr/`) (see `jupyterhub.md`). This is supposedly faster. Yet you will need to clone yourself the material.

At last, if you want to play the notebooks directly on your machine, the file [`installation.md`](installation.md) try to sum up what to install. If you want to play them through docker, additional instructions are found in [`docker.md`](docker.md).
