    "We are going to start this review by discussing numerical aspects of C++, because this course is all about scientific computing. Next we'll go over some advanced and important points of object-oriented programming. Then we'll revise pointers, the major source of errors in C++, as well as C. We'll finish the review by discussing templates. This C++ feature can give one a headache but, at the same time, it's one of the language's strong points as evidenced by the standard library. Fasten the belt !\n",
